 <b><u><emp>FIRST, RECALL THE TWO MAIN TOPICS COVERED IN LESSON 1-1</emp></u></b>
 
 <b>1. OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET = </B> 
 you were shown the "BIG PICTURE" view of how the internet works and were introduced to terms like "SERVER", "BROWSERS" -THE INTERNET/HTTP
 
 <b>2. INTRODUCTION TO HTML = </b>
  you were introduced to HTML tags like "B", "P", and "EM" and saw how even though these tages arent visable to users of the web page, they still carry meaning that is meaningful to web browser.
  
 <b><u><em>WHAT TO TAKE AWAY FROM LESSON 1-1?</em></u></b>
 
 <b>1. WHAT A WEBPAGE IS =</b>
 A webpage is a text document written in a language called "HTML, Web browsers read these documents then interpert and display them
 
 <b>2. HOW CODING WORKS =</b>
  coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
      FOR EXAMPLE:
      I'm "B" Learning to "/B" code!
       will look like this
       I'm <b>LEARNING</b> to code

<b>3. COMPUTERS ARE STUPID =</b>
   Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (Also known as Writing with Correct "SYNTHAX")
      FOR EXAMPLE:
If you forget to close a "B" tag, the computer wont be able to figure out what you had intended to make "BOLD"
This "STUPIDITY" can be very frustrating but it also gives programmers incrediable power. 
<b>(IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK TO A COMPUTER THAN YOU CAN TELL IT TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT)</b>

<b>4. PROGRAMMERS CANT REMEMBER EVERYTHING</b>
There are way too many details to keep everything in your head, And thats "OKAY"! If you forget how to make text "ITALIC" in html,
you can Always Just Look It Up!

<b> 5. BASIC HTML VOCABULARY =</b>
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you are comfortable with the "JARGON".

<b><u>TAG:</b></u> A HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an "OPENING"<> and a
CLOSING </>. Some tags called "VOID" tags do not requirea closing </> tag.

<b><u>ELEMENT:</b></u> A HTML element refers to anything within a set of opening and closing tags.

<b><u>ATTRIBUTE:</b></u> This is a property of an HTML element. For Example, to set the "HREF"" attribute of an anchor tag to the UDACITY URL,
 you would write "a HREF = www.udacity.com"/>
